## Installation ‚öôÔ∏è

### Option 1: Docker Setup (Recommended) üê≥

The easiest way to run this application is using Docker and Docker Compose:

#### Setup Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rajkelawala/Django-CRM.git
   cd Django-CRM
   ```

2. **Build and run with Docker Compose**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

3. **Access the application**:
   - Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8000`
   - Login with the default superuser:
     - Username: `admin`
     - Password: `admin123`
   - You should see a dashboard with 5 sample customer records

#### Troubleshooting For Windows Users (Important!)

If you're on Windows and encounter the error `exec /app/entrypoint.sh: no such file or directory`, this is due to line ending differences between Windows and Unix systems. The repository now includes a `.gitattributes` file to handle this automatically, but if you cloned before this fix:

1. **Re-clone the repository** (recommended):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rajkelawala/Django-CRM.git
   cd Django-CRM
   ```

2. **Or convert line endings manually**:
   ```bash
   git config core.autocrlf false
   git rm --cached -r .
   git reset --hard
   ```

4. **Troubleshooting** (if you see database errors):
   ```bash
   # Reset everything and start fresh
   docker-compose down -v
   docker-compose build --no-cache
   docker-compose up -d
   
   # Check logs if issues persist
   docker-compose logs web
   
   # Run troubleshooting script
   docker-compose exec web ./troubleshoot.sh
   ```

5. **To stop the application**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

6. **To rebuild after making changes**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

### Option 2: Manual Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rajkelawala/Django-CRM.git

   ```

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv virt
   virt\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Crete Migrations**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   ```
   
5. **Apply migrations**:

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

6. **Create a superuser**:
